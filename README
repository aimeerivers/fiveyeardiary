Five year diary

This is your private space where you can write your feelings every day, and compare against how you were feeling the same time last year, or last month, or view all mondays, or see a week at a time.

You can sign up to use https://fiveyeardiary.herokuapp.com or you can clone this source code and host your own.

If you wish to do that, here are the steps you would take to install it locally:

git clone git://github.com/sermoa/fiveyeardiary.git

cd fiveyeardiary
rvm use 1.9.2
bundle install

make a config/database.yml file using config/database.yml.sample as a guide. I use postgres but i reckon you could probably use mysql or sqlite.

rake db:create:all
foreman start
open http://localhost:5000

If you want to push it to heroku:

gem install heroku
heroku create --stack cedar
git push heroku master
heroku open
